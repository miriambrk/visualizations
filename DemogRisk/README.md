This graph shows three different sets of demographics vs health risks based on 2014 U.S. Census Bureau and the 2014 Behavioral Risk 
Factor Surveillance System. The three scatter plots are all contained within a single graph, and the user can select any of the 
x-axes to see the specific data. Data for each U.S. state is plotted, along with details when the user points at a state.
